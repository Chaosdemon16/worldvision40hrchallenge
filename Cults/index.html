      <h1>What is a cult?</h1>
      <p>
        A cult is usually a group led by a single charismatic leader who exercises total control over 
        the members, isolates them from society, and exploits them sexually or financially. Most cults 
        are what is known as a 'doomsday cult' which teaches its members about some apocalyptic event 
        that is going to happen and the only way to survive is to give their full devotion to the leader. 
        Many cults have a heavy emphasis on transcendent spiritual experience.

      <h1>Famous Cults</h1>
      <p>
        One of the most famous examples of a cult is that of the people's temple led by Jim Jones who in 
        1978 orchestrated a mass suicide of more than 900 people at Jonestown. Another infamous cult is 
        that of Heaven's gate, which was founded on the concept of rejecting human nature and ascending 
        to heaven  or the 'Next level'.
