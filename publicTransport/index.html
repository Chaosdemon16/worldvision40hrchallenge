      <h1>Public Transport</h1>
      <p>
        Pubic Transport is a key part of any city. It is the greenest mode of transport out there so 
        it is vital to get as many people onto buses as possible to reduce emissions. People will only 
        use public transport if it can get them to where they want to go fast and for cheap. If it is 
        more convenient or cheaper to drive then people will not use public transport.

      <p>
        The Auckland bus and train system is much too small, and nowhere near frequent enough to make 
        people use it instead of just driving. On top of that it is very expensive, with prices reaching 
        up to $12.70 with a hop card for a single trip and up to $6.30 for a child with a registered 
        hop card. With these prices it is no suprise that most people don't regularly use public 
        transport instead of paying a tiny bit more for much more convenience by driving.

      <h1>Free Fares</h1>
      <p>
        If the government fully payed for public transport fares much more people would use public 
        transport and thus get more cars off the road. Not only would less cars mean less emissions 
        it also means the government wouldn't need to pay as much to maintain the roads.
