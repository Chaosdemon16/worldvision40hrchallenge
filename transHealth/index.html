      <h1>Gender Affirming Care</h1>
      <p>As <a href="https://www.who.int/standards/classifications/frequently-asked-questions/gender-incongruence-and-transgender-health-in-the-icd#:~:text=What%20is%20gender%2Daffirmative%20health,affirm%20an%20individual's%20gender%20identity">
        defined</a> by the World Health Organization gender affirming health care is
        'any single or combination of a number of social, psychological, behavioural
         or medical (including hormonal treatment or surgery) interventions 
         to support and affirm an individuals's gender identity.'

      <h1>Benefits</h1>
      <p>
        Many children experience 'Gender Dysphoria' and feel a distinct disconnect 
        between their assigned gender at birth and their gender identity. Countless 
        studies have shown that these children are much more likely to experience 
        bullying and other forms of violence. Because of this many transgender youth 
        experience emotion distress and depression and many are driven to self-harm 
        and suicide. Gender affirming healthcare can greatly mitigate the chance of 
        suicide among transgender children. In a study of more than 9000 transgender 
        and non-binary youths they concluded that trans and non-binary youth under the 
        age of 18 are nearly 40 percent less likely to experience depression and attempt 
        suicide

      <h1>Opposition</h1>
      <p>
        Despite the clear benefits many people oppose trans healthcare because they do 
        not believe that trans people exist or that they are somehow sinful for wanting 
        to affirm their gender identity. These people have significant power and are 
        pushing to ban gender-affirming care in their countries and states. If they get 
        their way the suicide rates of the trans community will undoubtedly rise and the 
        stigma they face on a daily basis will be further reinforced.
