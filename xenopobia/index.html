      <h1>Xenophobia</h1>
      <p>
        Xenophobia is the 'fear and contempt of strangers or foreigners or of anything designated as 
        foreign or a conviction that certain foreign individuals and cultures represent a threat to 
        the authentic identity of one's own nation-state and cannot integrate into the local society 
        peacefully'. Essentially, Xenophobia is the contempt or fear of foreigners integrating into

      <h1>Xenophobia in South Africa</h1>
      <p>
        In the particularly extreme example of South Africa you can see what the implications that 
        Xenophobia can have are more than just snide comments. According to WitWatersrand University 
        in South Africa's Xenowatch xenophobic attacks resulted in a total of 669 deaths, 5,310 looted 
        shops, and 127,572 displacements between 1994 and March 2024. In May of 2008 alone attacks took 
        place in at least 135 different locations aroud the country. These attacks did not target white 
        people but targeted migrants from other african countries and from south asian countries who they 
        blamed for increased crime and unemployment.
