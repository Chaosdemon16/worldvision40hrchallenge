      <h1>Free Speech</h1>
      <p>
        Free speech is the right to state your opinion, share information, disagree with those 
        in power and to express your opinions in peaceful protests. Freedom of speech and freedom of 
        expression are protected under article 19 of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights.

      <h1>Censorship</h1>
      <p>
        Despite it being protected in international law many governments around the world violate their 
        citizens' freedom of expression by imprisoning people - or worse - that dare speak out against 
        them. The countries that completely control the media like Russia and China also significantly 
        restrict the freedom of information within their borders.

      <h1>Hate Speech</h1>
      <p>
        Many right wing individuals and groups excuse their hate speech as them excercising their freedom 
        of speech. Despite freedom of speech - even that which is deeply offensive - being protected under 
        international law, speech that violates the rights of others, or advocates hatred and incites 
        discrimination or violence isn't protected.
