      <h1>The Gender Pay Gap</h1>
      <p>
        The gender pay gap is the difference between women's and men's average hourly earnings. The 
        current country-wide rate is 8.6% which means that on average women are paid 8.6% less than men 
        this rate is even less for MƒÅori, Pacific, Asian, and Disabled Women.

      <h1>What causes it</h1>
      <p>
        We don't know for sure how much the gender pay gap is influenced by certain things, but we do know 
        some things that contribute to the gender pay gap. Many people say that the gender pay gap is 
        caused by the differences in occupation and industries (women are more likely to go into 
        lower-paid industries) but that only makes up about 20% of the current gender pay gap. We know this 
        because within industries there is still a large gender pay gap. What is likely the largest cause 
        of the gender pay gap is the concious and unconcious biases of employers. An employer is more likely 
        to higher a man for a high paying job because of sexism - perhaps not conciously.

      <h1>How to lower it</h1>
      <p>
          Because there are so many causes of the gender pay gap it is hard to find a solution. Pay 
          gaps can be reduced with pay equity (the same pay for the same amount of work) and employers 
          simply hiring more women.
