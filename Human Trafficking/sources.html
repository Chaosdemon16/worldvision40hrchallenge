          <h3><a href="https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/human-trafficking/faqs.html">United Nations Office on drugs and crime</a></h3>
          <p>UNODC is the leading entity within the United Nations system to address the criminal elements of human trafficking. It provides expertise and knowledge to UN Member States and assists them with the ratification and implementation of the UN Protocol on Trafficking. Its crime prevention and criminal justice experts support the development of national laws and policies on human trafficking, train and mentor a wide range of officials, including police officers, border control guards, labour inspectors and victim support specialists. With the guidance and mechanisms provided by UNODC, countries are better equipped to investigate and prosecute cases of human trafficking, dismantle the criminal networks behind this crime, trace the illegal proceeds and protect and assist victims.</p>
