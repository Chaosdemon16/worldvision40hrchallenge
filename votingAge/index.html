      <h1>Make it 16</h1>
      <p>
        Many people are campaigning to lower the voting age in New Zealand to 16 from 18. Their reasoning is that 
        16 and 17-year-olds are just as impacted by government decisions as people 18 and over and should therefore 
        have a say in those decisions. Their arguments align with the supreme court's ruling that preventing 16 
        and 17-year-olds from voting was unjustified age discrimination and that it was in breach of the bill of 
        rights. In early 2023 the labour government introduced a bill to lower the voting age to 16 and it passed 
        the first reading.
