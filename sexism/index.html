      <h1>Sexism</h1>
      <p>
        Sexism is the prejudice or discrimination based on sex or gender. Usually against women and girls, 
        it is the belief that one sex is somehow superior or more valuable than another. Sexism maintains 
        the patriachal system by reinforcing gender roles. Sexism occurs in nearly every aspect of life, from 
        simply taking a walk to sexual assault and horassment in workplaces.

      <h1>Education and Industry</h1>
      <p>
        Sexism is especially prevalent in the education system. While male students are often encouraged to 
        take classes around STEM female students are not. Many male-dominated industries are so toxic to 
        women that they are forced to leave, further reinforcing the myth that women are more 'delicate'. 
        In many countries women are discouraged or even outright barred from attending school.

      <h1>What can we do?</h1>
      <p>
        Since sexism is so rooted in western culture it is very difficult to dismantle it and achieve 
        gender-equity. However, we can reflect on our own sexism - conscious or not - and call out 
        any sexism we witness and advocate for women.
