      <h1>Universal Healthcare</h1>
      <p>
        Universal Healthcare also known as Universal Health Coverage means that all people have access 
        to the full range of quality health services they need - wherever they may be and without 
        financial hardship.

      <h1>United States</h1>
      <p>
        Despite the United States spending much more on healthcare than other countries per capita the 
        quality of its healthcare is much less. To put it in perspective the US spends almost twice as 
        much per capita on healthcare but has the lowest life expectancy among large wealthy countries. 
        The reason that the United States healthcare system is so bad despite so much funding is because 
        it does not universal healthcare coverage. Instead, Americans have to pay for healthcare from 
        their pocket, or get health insurance. The government does subsides some things though, elderly, 
        people with disabilities, veterans, and low-income people. Even with subsides healthcare prices 
        are still very high so most of the population has health insurance, either by paying themselves 
        or from employee benefits. There is still 8.5% of the population that is not insured and therefore 
        need to pay sky-high healthcare costs if something should arise

      <h1>New Zealand</h1>
      <p>
        New Zealand is among the top ten healthcare systems in the world, mostly because of universal 
        healthcare coverage. In New Zealand citizens and permanent residents get free or low-cost healthcare 
        with the government paying for most of it. Hospitals and specialist care are covered by the 
        government if a patient is reffered by a GP (General Practitioner). Seeing a GP can cost anywhere 
        between $19 and $55 but those at a lower income can apply for a community services card which will 
        reduce the already low cost of presriptions and GP visits.
