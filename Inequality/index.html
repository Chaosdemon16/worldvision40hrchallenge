      <h1>Economic Inequality</h1>
      <p>
        Economic Inequality is defined as the unequal distribution of income and oppurtunity 
        between different groups in society. Every country has it, it is a key part of capitalism 
        but some countries have less, while others have more.

      <h1>Gini Coefficient</h1>
      <p>
        There are many ways to measure economic inequality but the most widely used is the 
        Gini Coefficient. The Gini Coefficient is a scale from 0-100 where 0 is complete equality 
        and 100 is maximal inequality where 1 person has all the income while others have none. 
        Norway has the lowest inequality with just 22.7 whilst South Africa has a Gini Coefficient of 63!

      <h1>Income Tax</h1>
      <p>
        One way to mitigate inequality is by taxing the rich at higher rates than the poor. New Zealand's 
        income tax system does just that. It is what is known as a progressive tax system where as your 
        income increases so does your taxes, but your taxes do not increase on the income below the milestone.
        if you earn $14k you will be taxed at 10.5% but then if you earn an extra $1 your income will increase 
        to $14,001 but the original $14k will still be taxed at 10.5%, but the extra $1 will be taxed at 
        a rate of 17.5%. This means if you get a payrise you won't be left with less income than before because 
        your taxes went up.

      <h1>Wealth and Capital Gains Tax</h1>
      <p>
        The problem with income tax is that the richest people don't earn income like normal, instead they 
        earn money from stocks and properties. These don't fall under income tax which means that the rich 
        do not get taxed as much as the general population, worsening inequality. To resolve this issue 
        another tax is needed - Wealth tax, and capital gains tax. New Zealand does not have one. Implementing 
        a wealth and a capital gains tax would greatly reduce inequality.
