      <h1>The Treaty of Waitangi:<br>Te Tiriti o Waitangi</h1>
      <p>
        On the 6th of February 1840 the Treaty of Waitangi was signed by 40 rangatira at Waitangi. In the following months more than 500 rangatira - including a number of women 
        signed the treaty. The treaty resulted in the declaration of British sovereignty over New 
        Zealand.

      <h1>William Hobson</h1>
      <p>
        In 1839 the British government ordered naval captain William Hobson to negotiate for the 
        sovereignty of all or parts of New Zealand to be handed to the crown and to establish a 
        British colony. While he was en route he was advised by George Gipps - the governor of New 
        South Wales about drafting a treaty with Māori.

      <h1>The Drafting of the Treaty</h1>
      <p>
        William Hobson arrived in the bay of islands on 29th January 1840 and immediately set to work. 
        Along with his secretary James Freeman he drew up some notes for a treaty before handing them 
        off to James Busby who tidied them up and added to the. Over a single evening the treaty was 
        translated by missionary Henry Williams and his son Edward. William Hobson presented the treaty 
        to 500 Māori invited to Waitangi on 5 February. That night the rangatira gathered at Te Tii near the 
        Waitangi river to decide if they would sign.

        On the 6th of February 1840 40 rangatira signed the Māori version of the treaty. Over the following

      <h1>Lost in Translation</h1>
      <p>
        Likely because of the hasty translation of the document, there was a major difference between the Māori 
        version of the treaty and the English version. The Maori version gave the queen complete <i>governance</i> 
        over their land, while the English version gave the queen 'all the rights and powers of <i>sovereignty</i>' 
        these differences led to much debate over the meaning - The crown thought it could do whatever it wanted 
        while the Māori thought they still had sovereignty over their land.

      <h1>The Waitangi Tribunal</h1>
      <p>
        In an attempt to reconcile the differences between the texts the Treaty of Waitangi act 1975 
        created the Waitangi Tribunal. the purpose of the Tribunal was to examine and report on 
        proposed legislation that is reffered to them by the house of representatives or the Minister 
        of the Crown, and to make recommendation and determinations about land transferred to the crown's 
        ownership after the treaty.
