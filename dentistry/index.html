      <h1>Dentistry in NZ</h1>
      <p>
        Dentistry in New Zealand is free up to the age of 18. Adults over the age of 18 have to pay high prices 
        for dental care. Prices for a single tooth extraction are $229 on average and because of this most people 
        over the age of 18 just choose not to receive dental care. Because of the low uptake about 1 in 3 New 
        Zealanders live with untreated tooth decay, and half of adults have signs of gum disease which is linked to 
        a variety of health conditions including alzheimers, cancer, and heart disease.

      <h1>Universal Dental Care</h1>
      <p>
        New Zealand has universal health coverage and is among the top 10 healthcare systems in the world because 
        of that. Somehow though, we have nowhere near universal dental care. If we took our world-class healthcare 
        system and applied it to dentistry we would have much lower rates of tooth decay and gum disease.
