      <h1>Climate Change</h1>
      <p>
        Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These can be 
        natural, but since the 1800s humans have been the main cause for climate change by burning fossil 
        fuels like coal, oil and gas. When these fossil fuels are burned it creates greenhouse gasses 
        which make their way into the atmosphere and trap the sun's heat.

      <h1>C02 and Methane</h1>
      <p>
        The two main greenhouse gasses responsible for climate change are carbon-dioxide and methane. 
        These gasses are produced from gasoline when driving a car, or coal when heating a building. 
        Almost every daily task that requires electricity contributes to greenhouse gas emissions because 
        of the reliance on fossil fuels for generating electricity around the world.

      <h1>Humans are the problem</h1>
      <p>
        Climate scientists have found that all global heating over the past 200 years are because of humans. 
        The average temperature is now about 1.2Â°C warmer than in the late 1800s before the industrial 
        revolution. But climate change isn't just warmer temperatures, it has been linked with severe storms 
        and natural disasters, as well as declining biodiversity and rising sea levels from the melting of 
        polar ice.

      <h1>We have the solution</h1>
      <p>
        Despite the daunting problem, we know how to stop it. We all know that we need to reduce emissions 
        and a large number of people are trying to reduce their individual carbon footprint. However, even 
        if everyone in the world cuts down on their personal emissions we still won't be out of the fire,
        A large proportion of the world's emissions are from large companies that benifit financially 
        from using fossil fuels instead of more expensive cleaner forms of power. If these companies face 
        enough pressure from the public and from governments they will be forced to cut down on their 
        emissions by more meaningful amounts than they have promised to do thus far.
