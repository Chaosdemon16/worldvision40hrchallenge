      <h1>Nuclear Free Aotearoa</h1>
      <p>
        In 1987 the Labour government passed the New Zealand Nuclear Free Zone, 
        Disarmament, and Arms Control Act cementing in law New Zealand's stance 
        on nuclear technology and forever Aotearoa nuclear free.

      <h1>Nuclear Testing in the Pacific</h1>
      <p>
        From 1966 New Zealand was involved in protests against french nuclear 
        testing in the pacific, specifically around the Mururoa (or Moruroa) Atoll. 
        In 1972 Greenpeace ships sailed to the test site and the following year in May 
        the New Zealand and Australian governments took the French government to the 
        international court of justice to force them to ban the test. After the France 
        ignored the court's ruling Norman Kirk and the third labour government sent 
        Fraser Colman along with two navy frigates the HMNZS <i>Otago</i> and <i>Canterbury</i> 
        to the Atoll. The protests did lead to some success when - in 1974 - the new French president 
        Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing, ordered that the tests move underground.

      <h1>American ship visits</h1>
      <p>
        After the nuclear-powered frigate USS <i>Texas</i> visited NZ in 1983 there were 
        widespread protest throughout the country. At the next election the issue of nuclear 
        ship visits was a prominent issue. The USS <i>Texas</i> wasn't the first however, two 
        nuclear-powered cruisers the USS <i>Truxton</i> and the USS <i>Long Beach</i> had also 
        attracted protest when they visited in 1976. Because the Americans had a policy of 
        'neither confirm nor deny' public opinion was increasingly in favour of outright banning 
        these visits.

      <h1>The Rainbow Warrior</h1>
      <p>
         In 1985, Aotearoa was positioned as the leader of the anti-nuclear movement. Just before 
         midnight on the 10th of July two explosions ripped through the hull of the Greenpeace flagship 
         the <i>Rainbow Warrior</i> which was moored at the Marsden Wharf in Auckland. Fernando Pereira 
         who was a member of the crew who had been involved in protests against French nuclear tests 
         was killed in the explosions. As it turned out two DGSE officers Dominique Prieur and Alain Mafart 
         were responsible for the bombing on behalf of the french government. The New Zealand population was 
         outraged and began boycotting French imports. Meanwhile, France used its influence to threaten 
         New Zealand's access to the important market of the European Economic Community.

      <h1>Nuclear-free Legislation</h1>
      <p>
         In late 1984 when the United states requested for the ageing guided-missile destroyer 
         USS <i>Buchanan</i> visit New Zealand the Prime minister at the time David Lange stated that 
         'Whatever the truth of its armaments, its arrival in New Zealand would be seen as a surrender 
         by the government.' Finally in 1987 New Zealand was officially Nuclear-free.
