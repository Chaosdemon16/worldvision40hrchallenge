      <h1>HIV</h1>
      <p>
        HIV (<i>human immunodeficiency virus</i>) is a virus that attacks the cells that help the body 
        to fight infection, which makes a person more vulnerable to other infections and diseases. It 
        is spread through direct contact certain bodily fluids of a person with HIV. Most commonly 
        through unprotected sex or through the sharing of injection drug equipment. If untreated, HIV can 
        lead to the disease AIDS (<i>acquired immunodeficiency syndrome</i>)

      <h1>AIDS</h1>
      <p>
        AIDS is the latest stage of HIV infection and only occurs when the body's immune system is so 
        badly damaged from HIV. In developed countries most people with HIV don't develop AIDS because 
        they take HIV medicine which stops the progression of the disease. After developing AIDS the 
        person will typically survive around 3 years, less if they are infected with another disease. 
        Because the odds of surviving AIDS are so small, it is important to be tested for HIV in the 
        earlier stages.

      <h1>Treatment</h1>
      <p>
        HIV cannot be cured, but it can be prevented from developing into AIDS through HIV medecine 
        (called antiretroviral therapy). If taken as prescribed HIV medicine will reduce the the amount 
        of HIV in the blood to a very low level. People taking HIV medicine can live long and healthy 
        lives and will not transmit HIV through sex.
