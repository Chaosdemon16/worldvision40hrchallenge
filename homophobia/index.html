      <h1>Homophobia & LGBTQ+ Violence</h1>
      <p>
        Homophobia is the culuturally produced fear or prejudice againt homosexuals. It commonly 
        manifests itself in laws meant to restrict the ability for gay people to live their lives. 
        Often, Homophobia and anti-LGBTQ+ sentiment translates itself into bullying and violence 
        against members of the gay and LGBTQ+ community a.k.a gay bashing.
