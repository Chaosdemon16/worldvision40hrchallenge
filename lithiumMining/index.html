      <h1>Clean Energy</h1>
      <p>
        Over the past few decades the world has begun to transition to clean energy from fossil fuels. 
        Electric vehicles are in demand and the world is using more and more batteries. This increase in 
        demand is hand-in-hand with an increase in demand for lithium to create these resources.

      <h1>Environmental Impacts of Lithium Mining</h1>
      <p>
        Lithium mining results in about 15 Tonnes of CO2 emissions and an estimated 2.2 million litres of 
        water to mine 1 tonne of lithuim. The C02 emissions worsen the effects of climate change and the 
        significant water use leads to scarcity in already arid regions. When you consider that 130,00 tonnes 
        of lithium are produced every year you start to realise the sheer magnitude of environmental destruction 
        that is caused by lithium mining. Not only that but the chemicals used in lithium mining can 
        contaminate soil and water sources which poses risks to human health and wildlife.
