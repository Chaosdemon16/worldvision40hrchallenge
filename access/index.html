      <h1>Accessibility</h1>
      <p>
        Accessibility in public spaces refers to the design and implementation of infrastructure, facilities and 
        services that accomodate individuals with disabilities and help them to navigate public life without barriers. 
        It can include physical things like widened doorways, ramps, elevators, and tactile paving at crossings. 
        It can also include sensory things like braille signage, audio descriptions and visual alarms. It 
        encompasses every element of architecture and design that helps to accomodate individuals with disabilities

      <h1>Benefits everyone</h1>
      <p>
        Improved accessibility doesn't just benefit those with disabilities but also the elderly, parents with prams, 
        and temporary wheelchair uses with injuries. It also just makes the space much nicer - many people just 
        prefer walking up ramps or taking the elevator to stairs.
